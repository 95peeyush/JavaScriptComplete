What is JS?
    1.JS is High level,Object Oriented,Multi paradigm programming language.
    2.Programming Language means anything that can give instruction to computer to perform certain task.
    3.High Level means we don't have to worry about complex stuff like memory management.
    4.Object Oriented means based on objects.

What it does?
    1.Js add dynamic functionality to the website.

History
    1.ES5 then came ES6(ES2015) with biggest changes to language ever.
    2.Then after that every year a new version of JS is being launched with some new feature.
    3.JS from 2015 onwards is also called Modern JS.

Variables and Values
    1.Values are most fundamentals unit of information in programming language.
    2.We can store them in Variables to re-ues them.
    3.Not allowed to use reserved keywords as Variables name.
    4.One exception here (3rd point) name is a reserved keywords but still we can use that as a Variables name so it is recommended to not to use that.
    5.Can't redeclare a variable.
    6.constants are named in all capital.
    7.Every Value in JS is either a object or primitive type value.

Note->For writing errors to console we don't need console.log() it will get print directly.  

Data Types
    1.Number let age=23
    2.String let firstName="Peeyush"
    3.undefined let children;
    4.null similar to undefined
    5.boolean let isAble =true;(only true / false);
    6.symbols(unique that doesn't get changed)
    7.bigInt(introducted inm ES2020)

Note-> JS is dynamically typed language that means we don't specify the type of value it holds rather it is decided automatically depending on the value.
In other words it's value that has type not the variable.

Let,var and const
    1.let and const are part of modern js(es2015)
    2.const are the one which can't be changes or left undefined
    3.var is similar to let but let is block scoped and var is function scoped.

Operators
    1.Math Operators(+,_,*,/,%,**(power))
    2.Comparison Operators(>,<,>=,<=,==,===)
    3.Assignment Operators(=)
    4.typeof Operator

String and Template Literals
    1.From ES6 onwards we have template Literals to manage the complex strings formation.
